# What is Netgen Layouts?

**Netgen Layouts** is a visual layout management engine and page composition framework designed to separate *content structure* from *presentation layout*. It enables developers, editors, and designers to build complex, reusable page layouts without tightly coupling layout logic to templates or content models.

Rather than treating a page as a static template, Netgen Layouts introduces a dynamic layout layer that controls how content is organized, positioned, and rendered — making it possible to design modular, multi-zone page structures that adapt to different contexts and content sources.

At its core, Netgen Layouts acts as an orchestration layer between your content repository, rendering engine, and frontend delivery pipeline.

---

## Architectural Overview

Netgen Layouts is built around a modular, Symfony-based architecture with a strong emphasis on composability and extensibility.

Key architectural concepts include:

### Layout Containers and Zones
Layouts are composed of containers divided into **zones**. Each zone represents a configurable region of a page where content blocks can be placed. Zones allow independent layout behavior, permissions, and rendering strategies.

### Blocks
Blocks are reusable presentation units responsible for rendering specific types of content or functionality. A block might display:

- Lists of content items
- Featured articles
- Dynamic feeds
- Custom widgets
- External data integrations

Blocks encapsulate both configuration and rendering logic, enabling them to be reused across layouts.

### Value and Parameter System
Layouts use a structured configuration system that allows editors and developers to control behavior without code changes. Parameters define:

- Data sources
- Rendering rules
- Display limits
- Context-aware filtering

This promotes predictable, testable layout behavior.

### Rendering Pipeline
The rendering layer integrates with Symfony’s templating ecosystem. Layouts can render through Twig or custom view handlers, allowing developers to:

- Override block templates
- Inject dynamic context
- Apply caching strategies
- Optimize performance

Rendering is decoupled from layout definition, ensuring flexibility without sacrificing maintainability.

---

## Core Capabilities

Netgen Layouts provides advanced layout management features:

- Drag-and-drop visual layout editing
- Multi-zone page composition
- Reusable layout definitions
- Block-based content assembly
- Context-aware rendering
- Layout inheritance and overrides
- Role-based editing permissions
- Preview and staging workflows
- Performance-aware caching integration

These features enable editorial teams to control presentation while developers retain architectural authority.

---

## Developer Experience

For developers, Netgen Layouts offers:

- Symfony-native service architecture
- Dependency injection and event hooks
- Custom block development APIs
- Extensible rendering pipeline
- Composer-managed installation
- Clean separation of layout logic from business logic
- Integration points for headless or hybrid delivery

Layouts can be versioned, extended, and integrated into CI/CD pipelines like any other application component.

---

## Editorial Workflow

Editors gain a visual interface for assembling pages without modifying templates or touching code. This reduces deployment friction and accelerates iteration cycles while preserving developer-defined constraints.

Layout changes can be previewed and staged, supporting structured publishing workflows.

---

## Use Cases

Netgen Layouts excels in environments where presentation flexibility is critical:

- Enterprise CMS deployments
- Media and publishing platforms
- Marketing landing pages
- Multi-brand or multi-site systems
- Modular web portals
- Headless content orchestration

## Philosophy

Netgen Layouts embraces the principle that **layout is infrastructure** — not just decoration. By elevating layout management to a first-class system component, it enables scalable, maintainable digital architectures that empower both developers and editors.

---

In essence, Netgen Layouts transforms page composition from rigid template coding into a modular, configurable system that scales with organizational complexity.


# What is Netgen AdminUI Bundle?

**Netgen AdminUI Bundle** is a Symfony-based administrative interface framework designed to provide a structured, extensible backend UI for managing content, configuration, and system operations within Netgen-powered applications. It acts as the control surface for editors and administrators, translating complex backend services into a cohesive, user-friendly management environment.

Rather than being a monolithic admin panel, the AdminUI Bundle is an integration layer that connects domain services, APIs, and workflows into modular UI components. Its architecture prioritizes scalability, extensibility, and developer customization while maintaining a consistent editorial experience.

---

## Architectural Overview

Netgen AdminUI Bundle is built on Symfony’s bundle system and follows modern backend UI architecture principles:

### Modular UI Components
The interface is composed of reusable modules that represent distinct management domains — such as content handling, layout configuration, permissions, or system tools. Each module encapsulates:

- Routing and controllers
- Service bindings
- View models
- Templates and UI assets

This modularity allows features to be enabled, extended, or replaced without affecting the overall system.

### Symfony Integration Layer
The bundle leverages Symfony’s dependency injection container, routing, and event system to bind backend services to UI actions. Administrative workflows are implemented as service-driven operations, ensuring:

- Predictable behavior
- Testable logic
- Clean separation between UI and domain layers

### View Rendering System
Templates are rendered through Symfony’s templating stack (typically Twig), allowing developers to override views, customize layouts, or integrate frontend tooling while preserving core behavior.

### Permission and Role Awareness
Administrative actions are tied to Symfony security mechanisms. UI elements dynamically respond to user roles and permissions, preventing unauthorized access while simplifying interface complexity for editors.

---

## Core Capabilities

Netgen AdminUI Bundle provides a structured environment for administrative workflows:

- Content and configuration management interfaces
- Context-aware navigation
- Role-based UI visibility
- Modular dashboard architecture

- Responsive backend layout

These features allow organizations to scale administrative complexity without sacrificing usability.

---

### Developer Experience

For developers, the bundle offers a predictable extension model:

- Symfony-native bundle architecture
- Service and controller overrides
- Custom admin modules
- Event-driven UI extensions
- Template customization
- Asset pipeline integration
- Dependency-managed installation via Composer

Developers can introduce new administrative workflows without modifying core bundle code, enabling long-term maintainability.

---

## Editorial Workflow

Editors interact with a structured backend that exposes only relevant functionality. The UI emphasizes clarity and workflow efficiency, reducing training overhead while preserving advanced system capabilities.

Administrative actions map directly to backend services, ensuring data integrity and consistent behavior across environments.

---

## Use Cases

Netgen AdminUI Bundle is well suited for:

- Enterprise CMS backends
- Layout and configuration management
